## Why this repo?
We have a lot of developers on GitHub who might be simply unaware of what is happening here in Ukraine. Especially Russian and Belorussian developers whose government is hiding and distorting information. Many developers (not only Ukrainians) have tried reaching out to GitHub to support Ukraine, especially informationally (make a support banner/page), but they haven't done that yet.

This repository is an actively maintained consolidation of publicly available information which is free to share. Please, feel free to contribute by adding/updating valuable information.
## How can you help?

### Spread the Word
Every word matters. Even informing a single person makes a lot of difference.

Reach out to your relatives, friends, colleagues, especially Russian and Belorussian ones, and inform them what happens. Russian government constantly hides and distorts information. They block useful resources and spread misinformation to prevent disorder and coups in general. Russians think they can't do anything about it, that they are powerless, but they AREN'T. They are the majority who can help stop this madness and save thousands of lives. Do not blame them, instead help them make a correct decision.
